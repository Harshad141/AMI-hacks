# _COMBAT BOT_
## INTRODUCTION
> The world has been hit and shook on account of the dangerous **Corona Virus**
and nearly the total world is under lockdown so as to stop the spread of this
coronavirus. The best way to forestall the infection is being at home and
forestall going out at any expense.
> India has finished its 40 days lockdown effectively however India is
attempting its best to beat this fight yet country's economy is something that
should be stressed over now supposing that that is not focused then soon
or later we may likewise need to languish over a supper daily.


Consequently so as to keep up some economy there may be the need of
opening some significant industrial facilities and shops so that probably
some piece of the economy is there and there is no all out disappointment
of countrys economy all things considered.
## Problem Statement
> *Probably the most serious issue in opening production lines ,shops that are
fundamental for the economy and everyday essential need is that
individuals begin amassing in groups and break social separation which
can be perilous and can expand the quantity of crown transporters.
Ongoing news obviously shows how individuals have been disregarding
social removal for an enormous scope which can remove their lives as well
as can make issues for the residents of the entire nation. Likewise taking
care of such countless groups by police authorities isn't humanly/physically
conceivable in every single corner of the nation*.
## Solution:
> *So as to conquer this basic yet difficult issue we have thought of a bot that
empowers the police authorities to ensure that at whatever point there is
assembling under **government authorization** individuals consequently remain 
in a line keeping up appropriate separation of feet so spread of
coronavirus can be halted alongside that some significant things should be
possible*.

### Now lets look at it from Hardware point of view

### Function of the Bot
> At whatever point there is gathering this bot will ensure that individuals will
keep up legitimate separation between one another while remaining in the
line.


It has a Ultrasonic sensor that ensures that there is a particular separation
between two individuals such , separation between every individual can be
seen on the LCD screen mounted on the bot this as well as required data
like MOVE FORWARD ,MOVE BACKWARD is likewise given by the bot
relying upon the separation between two individuals
#### Circuit Diagram of the Bot

>NOTE: 
- This circuit diagram only shows the mounted Ultrasonic Sensor other components mentioned can be placed respectively in the power
pins followed by the digital pins.
- LCD should be first mounted on I2C LCD driver and to the two power pins and two analog pins.
- Buzzer should be placed to GND and 8th pin of Arduino.
- A wireless Camara should be palced on the Bot directly powered by the board which would send live feed to the reciver's device.
